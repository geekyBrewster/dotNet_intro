- It includes CLR - Common Language Runtime - which involves a lot of additional services that help manage resources, security, memory management, etc. for your application

# Where does .NET fit in the development stack?
- It looks like .NET would take the place of Node & Express in the MEAN stack.
- You can use .NET Core with front end frameworks like Angular, React, and ASP.NET
- It then connects on the back-end with SQL
